/*
 * This program uses the BleKeyboard library to convert the ESP32 into a programmable "bluetooth keyboard".
 * Using buttons connected to IO pins, the ESP32 can be triggered to send bluetooth keystroke messages to Ableton Live.
 * This program is intended to work within the "Session View" of Ableton.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * To compile, be sure to set the board type to: Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > ESP32 Dev Module
 * 
 * FUNCTIONALITY:
 * 
 * PRESS TYPE | LEFT PEDAL                    |  RIGHT PEDAL
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 *  Short     | Toggle: Record/Play/Restart   |  Next Track (Down Arrow - selects the slot directly below the currently playing slot - for layering/overdubbing)
 *  Long      | N/A                           |  Stop Slot/Retry (stop the currently playing slot and select the slot directly below)
 *  
 *  NOTES: 
 *  "Record" only activates on first press within a newly selected track.
 *  "Play" activates upon second press within an existing track.
 *  "Restart" activates upon all subsequent presses within an existing track.
 *  "Next Track" will go to the slot directly below the currently playing slot (equivalent to Down Arrow).
